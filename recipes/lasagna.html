                Pasta (lasagna)

            <li>
                Spices  
            </li>
            <li>
                Beef and Sausage
            </li>
            <li>
                Mozerella
            </li>
            <li>
                Egg 
            </li>
            <li>
                Onion
            </li>
            <li>
                Parmesan
            </li>
            <li>
                Tomato Paste
            </li>
            <li>
                Garlic
            </li>
            <li>
                Ricotta cheese 
            </li>
            <li>
                Parsley
            </li>

        </ul>

        <h4>Cheese Filling:</h4> For this classic lasagna recipe, 
        the filling contains ricotta and parmesan with seasonings and a couple of 
        tablespoons of parsley.<br> <!-- the br tag adds a line break within the same paragraph-->
        No ricotta? No problem, cottage cheese works just fine in this recipe!
    </p>
    <p>
        <h4>Meat:</h4> I use both Italian sausage and ground beef for great flavor. 
        If using all beef, add a ¼ teaspoon of fennel seeds and some Italian <br> seasoning 
        to the meat mixture for flavor.
    </p>
    <p>
        <h4>Sauce:</h4> To keep this sauce quick, I use pasta sauce or marinara sauce <br>
        (it’s easy to make from scratch with crushed tomatoes and canned tomatoes if you’d prefer).
    </p>
    <br>

        Homemade lasagna may have a few steps, but each step is easy and I assure you its worth the time;
        the perfect Italian meal! <br> This is a really easy lasagna recipe.
